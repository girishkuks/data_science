Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in preparing your dataset for linear regression. It involves understanding the data's structure, relationships, and patterns to ensure the model performs well. Below are the main aspects of EDA for linear regression, including what to check for and the actions to take for different scenarios.

1. Data Structure and Summary
What to Check:
Shape of the dataset: Number of rows and columns.
Data types: Ensure numerical features for regression.
Summary statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Actions:
If there are irrelevant columns, drop them.
Convert categorical variables into numerical using encoding methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
2. Missing Values
What to Check:
Presence of missing values in features or the target variable.
Actions:
Imputation: Use mean, median, or mode for numerical features. Use the most frequent category or a placeholder value for categorical features.
Drop rows or columns with excessive missing values.
3. Outliers
What to Check:
Identify outliers using box plots, z-scores, or the IQR method.
Actions:
Cap or remove extreme outliers.
Use robust scaling methods if outliers cannot be removed.
python
Copy code
import numpy as np

# Example of handling outliers
Q1 = data['feature'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data['feature'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
data = data[~((data['feature'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (data['feature'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))]
4. Relationships Between Variables
What to Check:
Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and the target variable.
Pair plots or scatter plots to visualize relationships.
Actions:
Remove highly correlated independent variables (multicollinearity).
Consider interaction terms or transformations for nonlinear relationships.
python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
5. Linearity of Features with Target
What to Check:
Ensure the relationship between features and the target is linear.
Actions:
Apply transformations (e.g., log, square root) if relationships are nonlinear.
6. Distribution of Features
What to Check:
Check for normality of features and target variables.
Identify skewed distributions.
Actions:
Normalize skewed data using log or Box-Cox transformations.
Use standardization or min-max scaling for numerical features.
python
Copy code
from scipy.stats import skew

# Example of skewness handling
skewed_cols = data.skew().sort_values(ascending=False)
log_transformed = np.log1p(data[skewed_cols.index])
7. Multicollinearity
What to Check:
Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.
Actions:
Drop one of the highly correlated features or use regularization methods like Ridge or Lasso.
python
Copy code
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

# Calculate VIF
vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
vif_data["feature"] = X.columns
vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
print(vif_data)
8. Residual Analysis (Post-Model Check)
What to Check:
Residuals should be randomly distributed (no patterns).
Actions:
Address any issues with feature transformations or model selection.
9. Feature Scaling
What to Check:
Check if features are on different scales.
Actions:
Standardize features using Z-score scaling or normalize using Min-Max scaling.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
10. Assumptions of Linear Regression
Linearity: Check scatter plots for a linear relationship.
Independence: Residuals should not show patterns.
Homoscedasticity: Variance of residuals should be constant.
Normality of Residuals: Use Q-Q plots or statistical tests.
Tools and Libraries
Pandas for data inspection and cleaning.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.
Scikit-learn for scaling and preprocessing.
By systematically applying these steps, you can ensure your data is clean, well-prepared, and ready for effective linear regression modeling. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any step!
